Repository for all non-professional activities of George Danforth, including but not limited to:
- **Music**: screeches, bleeps, and bloops. Listening is not advised.
- **Technology experiments**: various ways of moving bits around and getting computers to talk to each other. Bugs are guaranteed, usefulness is not.
- **Writing**: topics may include the above two activities as well as philosophy, armchair psychology, and various other matters in which I am not an expert. Opinions found on this site are most certainly not representative of the views my employers, and perhaps not even my own.

You can also find me [elsewhere](/contact/).
